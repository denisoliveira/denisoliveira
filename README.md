## About me

I am a Senior Mobile Engineer currently focused on **iOS development**, with solid professional experience across **Android** and **React Native**.

My career started with early mobile technologies (**J2ME**), evolved into **native Android**, and later consolidated in **iOS**, where I have built and maintained complex, large-scale applications used in production.

I have worked across multiple domains, including **fintech and payments**, **aviation**, **agribusiness**, **retail**, and **consumer marketplaces**, including platforms focused on **buying and selling used products**.

I have strong experience with **Design Systems**, **component libraries**, and **animations**, helping teams scale UI consistently while maintaining high-quality user experience.

I am particularly interested in **mobile architecture**, **performance optimization**, **low-level debugging**, and **computer vision**, and I enjoy turning complex or manual workflows into reliable digital solutions.
